                <h2>Oil - The World's Most Important Source of Energy</h2>
               <p>Petroleum or oil is a thick, yellow to black liquid found in rock layers. It is made up of organic
                material, formed millions of years ago from dead plants and animals. Deep in the ground pressure and
                heat transformed them into oil. Crude oil is oil in its natural state. Many other products are made out
                of petroleum. Every day our planet consumes about 90 million barrels of oil. Because oil needs millions
                of years to develop we will run out of the energy, which we so much depend on.</p><br>
                
            <h2> History of oil</h2>
                <p>Oil has been used in one form or another over thousands of years but it has become really important to
                our economy in the last 2 centuries. It has been the most important source of energy since the end ofWorld 
                War II.The first oil well was created in the middle of the 19th century in Pennsylvania. By 1870 oil production
                had spread to other American states. During the latter part of the 19th century oil was also produced in
                Canada and in European countries.
                The automobile boom of the early 20th century led to a higher demand of oil. It played an important role
                as the main fuel for tanks and planes in the two world wars.
                By 1950 the United States had become the world’s largest oil producer. In the second part of the 20th
                century Saudi Arabia and Russia produced even more than the USA.
                Today more than 90 percent of all vehicles are powered by oil products. It is the most important source
                of energy in our world. About 80% of the world’s oil reserves are located in the Middle East. Other
                notable producers are Venezuela, Great Britain and Indonesia.

            <h2>What petroleum is made out of</h2>
                <p>Crude oil consists mainly of hydrocarbons, a combination of hydrogenand carbon. Each deposit of
                petroleum has a different combination of hydrocarbons, thus making it a thicker or thinner liquid. It
                also has sulphur, nitrogen and other elements in it.
                </p><br> 

            <h2>How oil is produced</h2>
                <p>Before oil can be extracted from the earth geologists first must examine the land and the rock layers
                that lie underneath the surface. Up to about 30 years ago drilling for oil was a great risk. Geologists
                could not guarantee that oil would be found where they presumed. Today modern exploration methods make
                it possible to find oil with a 70% success rate.
                Most of the world’s oil is produced by drilling into the crust of the earth. Crude oil is found together
                with gas, which floats above the oil layer. Sometimes gas is extracted together with oil during the
                drilling process, at other times it is simply burned off when it comes to the surface.</p><br>

            <h2>Oil pumping station in Texas</h2>
                <p> oil can be brought to the surface a drilling rig is set up. Oil is often buried deep down in rock
                layers, so that drills must go down to a depth of 10000 meters and more. Offshore rigs operate on
                platforms in the ocean. They drill for oil underneath the ocean floor.
                After it is brought up to the surface crude oil is brought to refineries, where it is made into petrol
                or gas, heating oil, kerosene, fuel for airplanes and plastic products. Other chemicals and fertilizers
                are also made out of crude oil.
                Not all oil is found in rock below the surface. Some lies trapped in oil sands, but production is still
                expensive.</p><br>

            <h2>Petroleum industry</h2>
                <p> oil industry combines many different tasks. In addition to exploring new reserves, drilling and
                refining oil, the industry must also bring oil products to the consumer. Giant supertankers transport
                crude oil across the oceans all over the world. Pipelines bring oil over land from one part of a
                continent to another.</p><br>

            <h2>Price of oil</h2>
               <p>The price of oil changes constantly, depending on how much is produced and consumed. Many factors can
                influence the price of oil. Especially wars and conflicts in oil-producing countries can lead to a rise
                in oil prices. The energy crisis of the 1970s, for example, led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and
                threw the world’s economy into a deep recession. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
                (OPEC) has had a great influence on production and the price of oil since the 1970s.</p><br> 

            <h2> Oil consumption</h2>
                <p> of the world’s oil is needed in the western world. The United States is the world’s largest oil
                consumer. It uses up about a fifth of the daily oil production. Japan, the European Union and China are
                other major consumers of oil.</p><br>

            <h2>The world's oil reserves</h2>
               <p>Environmental effects of oil production
                Producing and consuming oil and oil products affects our environment in many ways.
                It is a major cause of global warming because burning fuel releases carbon dioxide, thus causing the
                greenhouse effect. Oil drilling is often damaging to the environment because chemicals are used to
                separate oil from water.
                In the past decades there have been a series of tanker accidents that have polluted the world’s oceans
                and seas. The biggest disaster was the sinking of the Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989. In
                2010 an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico spread to coastal areas in the USA and Mexico and polluted
                thousands of square kilometers of water.</p><br>
