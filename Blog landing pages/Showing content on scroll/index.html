                Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, consisting of a flat round base of dough baked with a topping of
                tomatoes and cheese, typically with added meat, fish, or vegetables.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pizza can help you absorb the antioxidant Lycopene. Lycopene is found in tomatoes, which are used to make
            the base sauce for pizzas. Lycopene helps to lower blood pressure and bring down high cholesterol. It's also
            more easily absorbed from cooked tomatoes as opposed to fresh tomatoes.</p>

        <p>Prerequisite: <i>(make a dough for 4 pizzas, of 12inch in diameter)</i></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600ml of warm water</li>
            <li>1kg of flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (25gm) of fresh yeast <b>or</b> 2 teaspoons (7-8 grams of dried yeast</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>

        <h3>Method <i>(step wise)</i></h3>
        <hr
            style="color: black; font-weight: bolder; margin-bottom: 20px; border:1px solid black; background-color: black;">
        <p> > Sprinkle the yeast into a medium bowl with the warm water.
            we don't mean hot, and we don't mean cold... we mean warm! That's the kind the yeast likes best. Stir until
            the yeast dissolves. </p>
        <p> > Place almost all of the flour on the table in the shape of anal
            volcano.(Think Mt. Vesuvius... appropriate
            since Naples is the king of all pizza cities!).</p>
        <p> > Pour the yeast-and-warm-water mix, along with the other ingredients, into the "crate" of the colcano. </p>
        <p> > Knead everthing together for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elasticm keeping your surface
            floured.</p>

            </div>
            <p>A well prepared pizza looks best and when the pizza looks best it gives the feeling of preminum and a
                feel of satisfaction to the eater.</p>

        <h2>Serving</h2><hr
        style="color: black; font-weight: bolder; margin-bottom: 20px; border:1px solid black; background-color: black;">

        <p>Serving is most important part of the foor prepration.</p>
        <p>
            <strong> Bring your dough to room temperature.</strong> <br>
            Gluten, the protein that makes pizza dough chewy, is tighter in cold conditions like the fridge, which is
            why cold pizza dough will stretch out and snap back just like a rubber band. This step will loosen up the
            dough and make it easier to shape.
